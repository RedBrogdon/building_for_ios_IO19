# Building for iOS with Flutter, Google I/O '19

This is the sample project shown during the iOS talk at Google I/O '19. 
It's a simple app with three screens: a list of fruits and veggies, a
form to record that you ate some of them, and a log that displays all
the data recorded in the past.

The code is intended to show how to adapt an app's user experience for
different platforms. For example, on iOS the app uses a flat navigation
architecture based on CupertinoTabScaffold, and on Android it uses
hierarchical navigation with a Material drawer. There are also a number
of smaller adaptations of the UI like different buttons, background
colors, and so on.
